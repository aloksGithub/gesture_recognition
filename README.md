# Echo State Networks and Long Short-Term Memory for Continuous Gesture Recognition: A Comparative Study

This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the experiments described in the article: 
[Echo State Networks and Long Short-Term Memory for Continuous Gesture Recognition: A Comparative Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-020-09754-0) by Doreen Jirak, Stephan Tietz, Hassan Ali and Stefan Wermter.

It contains code to train and test an Echo State Network and a LSTM on IMU gesture data recorded from 5 different people.
To see how to use the ESN please see ESN Experiment notebook, to see how to use the LSTM please refer to the LSTM experiment notebook.


To setup your environment please use the supplied conda requierements.txt file.
